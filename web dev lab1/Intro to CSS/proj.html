        <h1>Travel to the Hawaii</h1>
        <h2>The landscape was breath-taking</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/beach-waves-at-sunset.png" alt="beach waves at Hawaii" width="200">
        <p id="hawaii"> There are six major islands to visit in Hawaiʻi:<strong><em> Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Maui,</em></strong> and the island of <strong><em>Hawaiʻi!</em></strong> Each has its own distinct personality, adventures, activities and sights. We invite you to explore the Islands of Aloha to find your own heavenly Hawaiʻi experiences. </p>
        <h2>Aloha from Hawaii</h2>
        <h3 class="name-islands">Kauaʻi</h3>
        <p class="islands">Kauaʻi is Hawaiʻi's fourth largest island and is sometimes called the "Garden Island," which is an entirely accurate description. <br>
        The oldest and northernmost island in the Hawaiian chain is draped in emerald valleys, sharp mountain spires and jagged cliffs aged by time and the elements. </p>
        <h3 class="name-islands">Oʻahu</h3>
        <p class="islands"> Sometimes called “The Gathering Place,” Oʻahu certainly lives up to its name.<br> The third largest Hawaiian island is home to the majority of Hawaiʻi’s diverse population, a fusion of East and West cultures rooted in the values and traditions of the Native Hawaiian people. It’s this fundamental contrast between the ancient and the modern that makes discovering Oʻahu — from bustling city life to laidback surf towns — so enjoyable.</p>
        <h3 class="name-islands">Molokaʻi</h3>
        <p class="islands">Hawaiʻi’s fifth largest island, Molokaʻi is only 38 miles long and 10 miles across at its widest point and is home to the highest sea cliffs in the world and the longest continuous fringing reef. Molokaʻi remains true to its island roots, with a high percentage of its population being of Native Hawaiian ancestry who continue to preserve their rural lifestyle thanks to their love of the land. </p>
        <h3 class="name-islands">Lānaʻi</h3>
        <p class="islands">The smallest inhabited island travelers may visit in Hawaiʻi, Lānaʻi offers big enticements to its visitors. Only nine miles from Maui yet a world away, Lānaʻi can feel like two places. The first is found in luxurious resorts where visitors can indulge in world-class amenities and championship-level golf.  </p>
        <h3 class="name-islands">Maui</h3>
        <p class="islands">Maui, known also as “The Valley Isle,” is the second largest Hawaiian island. The island beloved for its world-famous beaches, the sacred ʻĪao Valley, views of migrating humpback whales (during winter months), farm-to-table cuisine and the magnificent sunrise and sunset from Haleakalā. It’s not surprising Maui has been voted "Best Island in the U.S." by Condé Nast Traveler readers for more than 20 years. </p>
        <h3 class="name-islands">Hawaiʻi</h3>
        <p class="islands"> The island of Hawaiʻi is the youngest and largest island in the Hawaiian chain. Nearly twice as big as all of the other Hawaiian Islands combined (hence, its nickname, “Big Island”), its sheer size is awe-inspiring. You can travel through all but four of the world's different climate zones here, ranging from Wet Tropical to Polar Tundra, a result of the shielding effect and elevations of the massive volcanoes Maunakea and Maunaloa. From the many geological features at Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park to the snow-capped heights of Maunakea; from the lush valleys of the Hilo and Hāmākua Coasts to the jet-black sands of Punaluʻu Beach, the island of Hawaiʻi is an unrivaled expression of the power of nature. However you decide to experience the island, it is sure to leave you humbled! Check out the island of Hawaiʻi's regions to explore this vast island. </p>
